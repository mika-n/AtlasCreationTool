minidx9
=======

Minimal cutdown DirectX9 SDK for buildbot use.

This is just files directly from the freely available DirectX SDK.

I do not claim that this is under any particular license other than what Microsoft applies.

-----------------------------

This minidx9 library was released as part of the NVIDIA texture tools package,
but the original source of MINIDX9 is the freely available version of Microsoft DirectX SDK.
