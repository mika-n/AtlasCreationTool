- Update User's guide
==========================================
- adjust wrap fudge interactively?!
- clean up the global mess that the viewer is in: 

- make atlas display of quad:
  - scale appropriately w/ texture dimensions...
  - stack for volume textures?
  
- switch over to refrast so these things and become vid-card caps independent...

- encode swizzle style 2D placement algs: enables more square atlases:
  required for cube-map support
- add cubemap support: simply collect 6 (or less!) same size texture into a cube map
  ignore width/height as a first step, ie can only collect same size, square textures 
  into a cube

- volumes should properly support -width -hiehgt: doesn't right now. 
  should code brute force alg that tries all possible width/height 
  combinations to find width-height-depth config that takes up least amount of bytes.
  
- add cubemap support: simply collect 6 (or less!) same size texture into a cube map
  fully general ala volume maps (see above)
